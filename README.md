# yelp-camp

<p>This is a project is a yelp for campgrounds. Made of a udemy bootcamp course: Web Development Bootcamp 2022.
Things to consider, in .gitignore there is the node_modules folder and an .env file that save api keys to could save the images in Cloudinary instead of in your local machine.
To get the same, create a free account on Cloudinary, and create a .env file on the top layer of your project, there save these key-value pairs but with your own information.
Also you have to create an account on mapbox to generate the maps and put your mapbox token in the .env file.</p>

<h4>Structure of the .env file</h4>

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=yourcloudname
CLOUDINARY_KEY=yourcloudinaryapikey
CLOUDINARY_SECRET=yourcloudinarysecret
MAPBOX_TOKEN=yourmapboxtoken

And by this the keys are save inside files property of req object.
